Reflection:

The project offered important insights into how digital innovation can solve real-world problems in campus health management. By using a design thinking approach, I learned the value of understanding user needs before suggesting solutions, especially in physical and mental health. The Digital Health Passport and Wellness Tracker demonstrate how integrating health records, wellness monitoring and mental health support in a single platform can improved accessibility, engagement, and awareness with the UTM community. Overall, this project deepened my appreciation for user-centred design, and it act as a role in creating impactful digital system for a smart and healthier campus.
